//The provided code is a mix of obfuscated and unobfuscated code. 
// The obfuscation technique used is variable name mangling, 
// where variable names are replaced with randomly generated names. 
// Here's the deobfuscated code:

function main() {
  var a = 5;
  var b = 10;

  if (a > b) {
    console.log("a is greater than b");
  } else if (a < b) {
    console.log("a is less than b");
  } else {
    console.log("a is equal to b");
  }

  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }

  var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  console.log(arr[2]);

  var obj = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
  };

  console.log("Hello, " + obj.name + "!");
}

main();
/*

The code defines a function main() that performs the following tasks:

1. Sets the value of a to 5 and the value of b to 10.
2. Checks whether a is greater than, less than, or equal to b and logs the appropriate message to the console.
3. Logs the numbers 0 through 9 to the console.
4. Defines an array arr with the values 1 through 5 and logs the value at index 2 to the console.
5. Defines an object obj with properties name, age, and city, and logs a message to the console that includes the value of obj.name.
6. Calls the main() function.
