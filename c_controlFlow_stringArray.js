/*
This code uses variable and function names that are not very helpful, making it harder to understand what the code is doing. 
Also, there is a lot of code that is not relevant to the main functionality, which seems to be a set of functions that perform 
basic arithmetic and string operations. I will provide a refactored version of the code that is easier to read and understand:
*/

const a = 5;
const b = 10;

function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

function divide(x, y) {
    return x / y;
}

function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

function getType(x) {
    if (typeof x === "string") {
        return "string";
    } else if (typeof x === "number") {
        return "number";
    } else {
        return "unknown";
    }
}

const c = "New York";
const typeOfC = getType(c);
switch (typeOfC) {
    case "string":
        console.log("c is a string");
        break;
    case "number":
        console.log("c is a number");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("c is neither a string nor a number");
        break;
}

/*
This code defines four arithmetic functions (add, multiply, divide), 
a string concatenation function (greet), and a function that determines 
the type of a given value (getType). It also defines two variables (a and b) 
and a string variable (c), and then uses getType to determine 
the type of c and logs an appropriate message to the console.
